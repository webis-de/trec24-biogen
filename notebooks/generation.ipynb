By reducing inflammation and blocking pain signals, Ibuprofen effectively treats headaches and provides relief.'}], 'created': 1717408615, 'model': '1 - Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 - the best option in general - fast and good', 'object': 'text_completion', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'usage': {'completion_tokens': 139, 'prompt_tokens': 61, 'total_tokens': 200}}, 'kwargs': {'temperature': 0, 'max_tokens': 250, 'top_p': 1, 'frequency_penalty': 0, 'presence_penalty': 0, 'n': 1, 'model': '1 - Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 - the best option in general - fast and good', 'prompt': 'Given the fields `question`, produce the fields `answer`.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFollow the following format.\\n\\nQuestion: ${question}\\nAnswer: ${answer}\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: How does Ibuprofen work to treat headaches?\\nAnswer:'}, 'raw_kwargs': {}}\n",
