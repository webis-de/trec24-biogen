He came up with the sentence \"A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\" because it used every letter of the alphabet and flowed well when typed.\\n\\nAnother theory is that the sentence was inspired by a line from Edward Lear\\'s nonsense poem \"The Jumblies,\" which reads \"They went to sea in a Sieve, they did.\" This sentence also uses every letter of the alphabet, but it'}],\n",
